<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This paper presents a rap-style commentary system for enhancing Audience Participation Games (APGs), which are games--on live streaming services--that allow audiences to participate with an aim to promote their experience. We focus on common limitations in traditional APGs: humans cannot provide entertaining contents, both gameplay and commentaries, on the 24/7 basis. Therefore, an APG is developed where the game is played by artificial intelligence algorithms (AIs) and commentaries are generated in a musical fashion by the rap-style commentary system.
Descriptions are given on a design to make an existing fighting game become an entertaining APG through the process of AI strength adjustment based on chat messages from audiences, and on how to apply such strength adjustment to generate game commentaries. 
Experimental results show that the proposed system promotes audience experience.
